Nouns DAO has become a household name, and we propose that Name DAO is a similar idea, but with pre-built "teamsg". If you are an Adam, you are likely to want to be a part of and support the goals of Adam DAO! Same for Joshs, and everyone else! But, right now, these groups are disorganized and disconnected, with no manner to grow. NAMES is the Nouns-ish way to bring Name-based DAOs to the world, while giving them a way to stay connected to one another.
